# MATLAB Scripts for Preprocessing and Visualization

This folder contains auxiliary MATLAB utilities used in the preprocessing and visualization stages of the project **VoxelMorph-breastMRI-registration**.

These scripts support the Python-based pipeline by facilitating initial data preparation and post-registration qualitative inspection.

## Contents

### `imresize3`
Used to resample both DTI and perfusion volumes to the input resolution required by the VoxelMorph model (160×192×224).  
Also reused to homogenize the high-resolution voxel sizes of both modalities when rescaling and applying deformation fields.

### `imshowpair`
Used for 2D multimodal visualization. Enables slice-by-slice overlay between DTI and perfusion images to qualitatively assess registration quality. Especially useful for detecting misalignment in individual planes.

### `vol3d` and `volumeViewer`
Used for interactive 3D visualization of registered or fused volumes. While `vol3d` allows RGB overlay rendering, `volumeViewer` is suitable for single-modality exploration (DTI or perfusion separately).It is helpful for anatomical inspection in 3D when observing each modality independently.


## Notes
- These scripts were not part of the deep learning training pipeline, but were essential for data preprocessing and qualitative evaluation.
- All volumes were saved in NIfTI format to ensure compatibility with the Python-based workflow (e.g., in Google Colab).

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2024b or later
- Image Processing Toolbox
- `vol3d` (available via FileExchange or included in some MATLAB distributions)

For further details on how these utilities were used, refer to Chapter 4 of the TFG report.

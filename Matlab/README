# MATLAB Scripts for Preprocessing and Visualization

This folder contains auxiliary MATLAB utilities used in the preprocessing and visualization stages of the project **VoxelMorph-breastMRI-registration**.

These scripts support the Python-based pipeline by facilitating initial data preparation and post-registration qualitative analysis.

## Contents

### imresize3
Used to downsample both DTI and perfusion volumes to the input resolution required by the VoxelMorph model (160×192×224).  
Also used later to homogenize the high-resolution volumes of both modalities during the final step of rescaling and applying the deformation fields.

### imshowpair
Used for 2D multimodal visualization. Enables side-by-side comparison or RGB overlay between DTI and perfusion images to assess registration quality.

### vol3d and volumeViewer
Used for interactive 3D visualization of registered volumes. Helpful to assess anatomical alignment across slices and volumes.

## Notes

- These scripts were not part of the deep learning training pipeline, but were used in essential preprocessing and evaluation steps.
- All data was processed and saved in NIfTI format to ensure compatibility with the main Python-based workflow in Google Colab.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2019b or later
- Image Processing Toolbox
- vol3d (available on FileExchange or included in some MATLAB distributions)

For further details on how these utilities were used, refer to Chapter 4 of the TFG report.
